## Description
This was a school project in which we had to create a blog with nextjs, in order to understand how this framework works. All of this was done by following a tutorial on the nextjs website (link in the credits section).

### What can this do ?
It's a really simple website. You can access 3 pages on it, you can navigate between pages with links and there is one link to redirect you to the nextjs tutorial

## How to install
Setup
First, make sure that your development environment is ready. You will need Node.js

If you don’t have Node.js installed, install it from here : https://nodejs.org/en/ 
You’ll need Node.js version 10.13 or above.
You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.

## How to use
### Create a Next.js app
To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:
```terminal
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
```
### Run the development server
You now have a new directory called nextjs-blog. cd into it:
```terminal
cd nextjs-blog
```
Then, run the following command:
```terminal
npm run dev
```
This starts your Next.js app’s "development server" on port 3000.
Open http://localhost:3000 from your browser to access it. 
For the rest, you can just follow the tutorial
